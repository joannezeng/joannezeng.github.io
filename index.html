            Hi! My name is Joanne. I'm a sophomore at Lowell High School in San Francisco, CA. 
            I enjoy meeting new people, trying new things, reading, and watching television shows. 
            My skills include organization and time management. This is my personal website, 
            meant to let you get to know me better and see some of my work and experience.</p>
